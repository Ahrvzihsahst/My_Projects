## Installation

To run the project, install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization.git
cd text-summarization
```

2. Run the provided Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook `Extractive Text_Summarization.ipynb` and execute the cells.

## Components

The project includes the following key components:

1. Tokenization: The code tokenizes input text into individual words.
2. Word Frequencies: Calculates the frequency of each word in the text.
3. Sentence Scores: Assigns scores to sentences based on the frequency of their constituent words.
4. Text Summarization: Selects the top 40% of sentences and generates a summary.

## Results

The project successfully generates a summary for a given piece of text using the SpaCy library. The summarization process includes the identification of key terms, removal of stopwords and punctuation, and selection of the most important sentences based on scores.
