# Left-Handed People's Age at Death Analysis

## Task 1

### 1. Where are the old left-handed people?

In this notebook, we explore the phenomenon of left-handedness and its correlation with age at death. Using age distribution data, we aim to determine if there is a significant difference in the average age at death between left-handed and right-handed individuals. The analysis utilizes Bayesian statistics and pandas to examine the probability of being a certain age at death based on handedness.

A National Geographic survey conducted in 1986 provided valuable data on age, sex, and hand preference for a large sample. Researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki observed a decline in left-handedness rates with age, attributing it to changing social acceptability rather than age itself. We will investigate this trend and its implications.

## Task 2

## 2. Rates of left-handedness over time

We convert the data to display the rates of left-handedness as a function of the birth year, averaging over male and female rates. This allows us to understand how left-handedness rates have evolved over time since the study was conducted in 1986.

## Task 3

### 3. Applying Bayes' rule

Bayes' theorem is applied to calculate the probability of dying at a certain age given left-handedness (P(A | LH)) and right-handedness (P(A | RH)). This involves considering conditional probabilities and updating beliefs based on evidence.

## Task 4

### 4. When do people normally die?

We estimate the probability distribution of ages at death using death distribution data for the United States in 1999. This distribution will serve as a baseline for comparing ages at death for left-handed and right-handed individuals.

## Task 5

## 5. The overall probability of left-handedness

We calculate the overall probability of being left-handed (P(LH)) in the population of deceased individuals. This involves summing up left-handedness probabilities for each age, weighted by the number of deceased people at each age.

## Task 6

## 6. Putting it all together: dying while left-handed (i)

We combine probabilities to calculate P(A | LH), the probability of being a particular age at death given left-handedness, using Bayes' rule.

## Task 7

## 7. Putting it all together: dying while left-handed (ii)

We repeat the calculation for right-handed individuals to obtain P(A | RH), the probability of being a particular age at death given right-handedness.

## Task 8

## 8. Plotting the distributions of conditional probabilities

We visualize the distributions of conditional probabilities for both left-handed and right-handed individuals across a range of ages at death.

## Task 9

## 9. Moment of truth: age of left and right-handers at death

We calculate the average ages at death for left-handed and right-handed individuals based on the probability distributions.

## Task 10

## 10. Final comments

We discuss the results, considering factors that may impact the age gap between left-handed and right-handed individuals. Additionally, we explore the expected age gap in 2018, reflecting the changing landscape of left-handedness rates over time.

The analysis provides insights into the relationship between handedness and age at death, debunking the notion that left-handed individuals die younger. The results are based on available data and assumptions, acknowledging potential variations due to sample size, study year, and regional differences.
