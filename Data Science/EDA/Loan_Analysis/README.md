## Introduction

This notebook contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on bank loan default risk. It is written in Python and uses data from the Loan Defaulter dataset, which contains information about 1000 loan applicants who defaulted or did not default on their loans. The notebook is an example of how EDA can be used to explore and understand data before applying machine learning techniques. It demonstrates how EDA can help to identify patterns, trends, outliers, relationships, anomalies, and insights from the data that can inform decision making and problem solving.

## Dependencies
